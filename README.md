# Exam Weeks and My Cigarette Consumption


## **1. Project Overview**

This project explores how my cigarette consumption changes during exam weeks. Using personal tracking data, I will analyze smoking patterns and examine correlations between stress levels and cigarette consumption.

## **2. Motivation**

Exam periods are often stressful, and habits such as smoking may be influenced by academic pressure. Understanding these patterns could provide insights into how stress impacts behavior and potential ways to manage it.

## **3. Dataset**

The dataset for this project consists of several weeks of daily records. Here’s what I’ll be tracking:

- **Date**: The specific day of the record.
- **Cigarettes Smoked**: Total number of cigarettes consumed that day.
- **Stress Level**: Self-reported stress level on a scale of 1–10.
- **Study Hours**: Total number of hours spent studying.
- **Sleep Duration**: Total sleep duration (hours).
- **Sleep Quality**: Self-rated sleep quality (scale of 1–10).
- **Physical Activity**: Whether any exercise was done (Yes/No).
- **Weather Condition**: Data on temperature, humidity, and conditions (e.g., rainy, sunny).
- **Day Difficulty**: A self-assessed rating of how challenging the day was (scale of 1–10).

I will record this data daily in an Excel file to maintain consistency and accuracy in collection. Any anomalies resulting from illness, unforeseen circumstances, or major routine shifts will be identified and marked for further analysis.

## **4. Methodology**

The project will follow the data science pipeline:

1. **Data Collection**: Log daily smoking habits, stress levels, study hours, and sleep duration.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing or inconsistent entries
   - Normalize numerical features
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing trends in smoking frequency over time
   - Identifying correlations between stress, study load, and cigarette consumption
   - Graphs and charts for better insights (matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly)
4. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Assessing statistical significance of smoking patterns during exam weeks
5. **Visualization of Results**:
   - Visualizations and insights via graphs and dashboards
   - Summary report on findings and recommendations


## **5. Limitations**
- **Small Sample Size**: Since the data is personal, it may not be generalizable.
- **Self-Reported Data**: Subjectivity in stress levels may introduce bias.
- **External Factors**: Other lifestyle choices (e.g., caffeine intake, exercise) may also influence smoking habits but are not included in this study.
- **Short-Term Analysis**: The study is limited to a few weeks and may not capture long-term patterns.


## **6. Tools & Technologies**

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels
- **APIs**: OpenWeatherMap (optional)
- **Version Control**: GitHub for tracking progress


## **7. Conclusion**
This study aims to provide insights into how academic stress influences cigarette consumption. By tracking personal data and analyzing trends, we can gain a better understanding of behavioral responses to stress. While the dataset has its limitations, it serves as a useful exploration of habit formation and stress management strategies.
