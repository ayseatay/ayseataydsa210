# Flight_Delay_Project
# Predicting Flight Delays Using Weather and Airline Data

## **1. Project Overview**
This project aims to analyze factors contributing to flight delays and build a predictive model to forecast whether a flight will be delayed based on weather conditions and airline data. The study will leverage publicly available flight and weather datasets to uncover patterns affecting flight punctuality.

## **2. Motivation**
Flight delays cause significant inconvenience to passengers and financial losses to airlines. Understanding the key factors that lead to delays can help airlines optimize schedules, improve customer experience, and enhance operational efficiency. By applying data science techniques, we aim to develop a reliable model for predicting flight delays.

## **3. Data Sources**
- **Primary Data**: Publicly available flight data from sources such as:
  - FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) flight performance data
  - Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) on airline on-time performance
  - OpenSky Network for real-time flight tracking
- **Enrichment Data**: Weather and airport-related data such as:
  - OpenWeatherMap API (historical and real-time weather data)
  - NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) weather reports
  - Airport congestion data

## **4. Methodology**
The project will follow the data science pipeline:
1. **Data Collection**: Acquire historical flight and weather datasets.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values
   - Normalize numerical features
   - Merge flight data with weather data
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing trends in flight delays across different airports and times
   - Understanding correlations between weather conditions and delays
4. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Assessing statistical significance of factors contributing to flight delays
5. **Machine Learning Model Development**:
   - Classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
   - Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
6. **Presentation of Results**:
   - Visualizations (matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly)
   - Summary report on findings and recommendations

## **5. Expected Deliverables**
- A well-documented **GitHub repository** with:
  - Python code for data analysis and modeling
  - `requirements.txt` listing dependencies
  - Jupyter notebooks for EDA and ML models
- A final report or interactive dashboard to present findings
