# Exam Weeks and My Cigarette Consumption


## **1. Project Overview**

This project explores how my cigarette consumption changes during exam weeks. Using personal tracking data, I will analyze smoking patterns and examine correlations between stress levels and cigarette consumption.

## **2. Motivation**

Exam periods are often stressful, and habits such as smoking may be influenced by academic pressure. Understanding these patterns could provide insights into how stress impacts behavior and potential ways to manage it.

## **3. Data Sources**

- **Primary Data**: Personal tracking of daily cigarette consumption over several weeks, including:
  - Number of cigarettes smoked per day
  - Stress levels (self-reported on a scale of 1-10)
  - Study hours per day
  - Sleep duration per night
- **Enrichment Data**: Additional sources such as:
  - Weather conditions (OpenWeatherMap API)
  - Academic workload (exam schedules, assignment deadlines)

## **4. Methodology**

The project will follow the data science pipeline:

1. **Data Collection**: Log daily smoking habits, stress levels, study hours, and sleep duration.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing or inconsistent entries
   - Normalize numerical features
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing trends in smoking frequency over time
   - Identifying correlations between stress, study load, and cigarette consumption
   - Graphs and charts for better insights (matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly)
4. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Assessing statistical significance of smoking patterns during exam weeks
5. **Machine Learning Model Development (Optional)**:
   - Regression models to predict cigarette consumption based on stress levels
   - Model evaluation using RMSE and RÂ² scores
6. **Presentation of Results**:
   - Visualizations and insights via graphs and dashboards
   - Summary report on findings and recommendations

## **5. Expected Deliverables**

- A well-documented **GitHub repository** with:
  - Python code for data analysis and visualization
  - `requirements.txt` listing dependencies
  - Jupyter notebooks for EDA and statistical analysis
- A final report summarizing insights and personal reflections

## **6. Limitations**
- **Small Sample Size**: Since the data is personal, it may not be generalizable.
- **Self-Reported Data**: Subjectivity in stress levels may introduce bias.
- **External Factors**: Other lifestyle choices (e.g., caffeine intake, exercise) may also influence smoking habits but are not included in this study.
- **Short-Term Analysis**: The study is limited to a few weeks and may not capture long-term patterns.

## **7. Timeline**

| Task                             | Deadline |
| -------------------------------- | -------- |
| Submit project proposal (GitHub) | March 10 |
| Data collection and logging      | April 18 |
| Data analysis and visualization  | May 23   |
| Final report and submission      | May 30   |

## **8. Tools & Technologies**

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels
- **APIs**: OpenWeatherMap (optional)
- **Version Control**: GitHub for tracking progress

## **9. Future Work**
- **Expanding Data Collection**: Extending the study across multiple semesters for a larger dataset.
- **Incorporating More Variables**: Tracking diet, exercise, or other stress-coping mechanisms.
- **Comparative Study**: Analyzing similar habits among peers to see if trends are consistent.
- **Machine Learning Implementation**: Developing predictive models based on stress and workload factors.
- **Behavioral Interventions**: Exploring ways to reduce smoking habits during stressful periods.

## **10. Conclusion**
This study aims to provide insights into how academic stress influences cigarette consumption. By tracking personal data and analyzing trends, we can gain a better understanding of behavioral responses to stress. While the dataset has its limitations, it serves as a useful exploration of habit formation and stress management strategies.

## **11. Academic Integrity**

All sources will be properly cited. Any use of AI tools will be explicitly documented.
